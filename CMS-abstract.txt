Data grouping.

A (game) project can be made in the CMS
A project MUST have at least one owner.

The project OWNER can allow collaboration in different forms.
 -PULL collaboration (ask a specific question, contest it..)
	 -create a behaviourplay-pen
	 -create an data group slot
	     -a data groups slot, must contain a minimum of 3 texts, 1 picture, one sound.. and or.....
              and can have version..

 -PUSH collaboration (suggestion box)
	 -elevator pitch (picture/text / movie)
	 -suggestion-box (with subjects).
	 -assets / sound / images / animation etc..

	 -code-lifts core development, lib development, behaviours.

The collaborator can ALWAYS try out his/her collaborations in the local cookie.
But can also PUSH collaboration.
	GAME DESIGN (general suggestions)
